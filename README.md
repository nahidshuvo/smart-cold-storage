# smart-cold-storage
The idea of smart cold storage has been proposed for many years. We present a smart cold storage system that captures the features of modern smart cold storage. Which will serve as a hub to improve efficiency and speed up the process throughout the entire supply chain. This system incorporates an IOT-based smart cold storage that interacts with the environments within. The whole smart system runs with ARDUINO which monitors temperature, humidity & triggers fire alarm by using a gas sensor. An efficient lighting system & door automation are also included. There is an option to upgrade and improve the system, with opportunities for fingerprint recognition.
